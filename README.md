Hi, welcome to the source code for my website.  
This is my first project and I'm learning a lot about seeing a project through from start to finish.  
Please email me @ ghp7469@nyu.edu for any suggestions!  
Todo:  
1. Update to REM units
2. Update so JS implmenets
3. Update so functional on mobile (maybe)
4. Migrate to domain outside of GH Pages
